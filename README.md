VALUE = A1APEN(X) computes the a1ApEn of a vector X.

VALUES = A1APEN(X, WINDOW_SIZE)computes the moving a1ApEn of a vector X, using non-overlapping windows with WINDOW_SIZE points.

VALUES = A1APEN(X, WINDOW_SIZE, STEP) computes the moving a1ApEn of a vector X, using windows with WINDOW_SIZE points and setting the interval between adjacent epochs equal to STEP.
